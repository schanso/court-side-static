				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obviously, these shot charts look nothing like <a href="https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/media" target="_blank">Kirk Goldsberry&#8217;s</a>. We don&#8217;t really have specific shooting locations available for BBL teams, certainly not for players. (We got <a href="http://live.beko-bbl.de/?L=bbl&amp;H=435&amp;game=15276" target="_blank">this here</a>, you decide for yourselves whether you find it useful.)<br />
I still wanted to experiment a little, so what I did here is simply seperating the shot chart into shooting percentags from near-distance, from mid-range, and from 3-point land (as available in Beko BBL&#8217;s play-by-play). The colors range from a dark green (really good) over yellow (mediocre) to a dark red (really bad), always compared to the rest of the league.</p>
<p>Take Artland as my first try:</p>
<div id="attachment_537" style="width: 935px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://court-side.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/artland_all.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-537 " title="Artland Dragons Shot Charts" alt="artland_all" src="http://court-side.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/artland_all.jpg" width="925" height="374" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Artland Dragons&#8217; Shot Charts for the 2013/2014 Beko BBL Season. (All numbers per Apr. 5, 2014, 28 games played.)</p></div>
<p><span id="more-552"></span></p>
<p>Few words concerning Artland&#8217;s offensive output:</p>
<p><b>3-Point Shooting</b>:<br />
This comes first, because Artland Dragons are a <strong>really good 3-point shooting</strong> team. Lawrence Hill is shooting 50.5 % from three-point land for the season (47-93 3P), which is insane. Topper is at 41.5 % (44-106 3P), and they have two more guys in Bastian Doreth and Guido Gr端nheid shooting above 40 % (three, if you count Anthony King&#8217;s 2-5 3P). As a team, this puts Artland into 3rd place in 3P% behind only Oldenburg and Bayern.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-Range Shooting</strong>:<br />
Now, this is where they are not really good at. Artland take 16.4 % of their shots from mid-range, that&#8217;s above-average. Only 5 teams take a higher number of shots from that distance compared to their overall field goal attempts. Which wouldn&#8217;t be too bad, if the Dragons showed some good shooting percentages from that distance (like Berlin for example). But, actually, <strong>no team shoots worse from here</strong>: League-average is 37.3 %, Dragons shoot a lowsy 29.9 %.</p>
<p><strong>Near-Distance Shooting</strong>:<br />
Statistically, you want a lot of shots from near the basket. Now, Anthony King and Kenneth Frease (Artland&#8217;s Centers) are not those kind of players that carry you on offense. Other bigs like Hill or Gr端nheid might rather take the three than going inside. So, the Dragons <strong>don&#8217;t go there as often as other teams</strong> do: 45.1 % of all field goal attempts they take come from the area between the basket and the free-throw line (again: according to the official Beko BBL play-by-play data). That&#8217;s below-average, only Braunschweig, Vechta, and W端rzburg take less of those &#8220;easy&#8221; shots.</p>
